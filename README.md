# Markerless Gait Analysis using 3D Human Pose Estimation for Physical Assessment

## Project Description
This project aims to address the following problems on markered gait analysis systems: (1) high cost, (2) high setup time, and (3) possible gait obstruction by suit. By creating GaitScape, the pipeline from data collection to visual data interpretation is streamlined with a modern, intuitive GUI.
