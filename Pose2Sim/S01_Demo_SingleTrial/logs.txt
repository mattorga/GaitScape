Converting C:\Users\Matthew\anaconda3\envs\thesis\Lib\site-packages\Pose2Sim\S01_Demo_SingleTrial\calibration\Calib.qca.txt to .toml calibration file...

--> Residual (RMS) calibration errors for each camera are respectively [0.221, 0.235, 0.171, 0.191] px, 
which corresponds to [0.402, 0.445, 0.45, 0.505] mm.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 9.2 px, which roughly corresponds to 16.8 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
Gaps were interpolated with cubic method if smaller than 10 frames.
In average, 0.81 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera cam_03 was excluded 44% of the time, Camera cam_01: 17%, Camera cam_04: 14%, and Camera cam_02: 5%.
